for 2018 IoT Workhops given by Oracle Italian Business Innovation Team

here you find:
- a Python program that can be used as a simple device simulator
- Java code implementing a simple IoT DCD client
- Java code implementing an MQTT subscriber
- a data file, containing real data taken from a "box" full of sensors

to use this code you need:
- access to an Oracle IoT Cloud Service instance
- a VM with an MQTT broker
- Internet connection (of course)

you can find a Tutorial on Medium:
- Italian version: https://medium.com/@luigi.saetta/oracle-iot-uno-starter-versione-italiana-251e9ac18127
- English version_ not yet available (see you soon)

Feedback:
- please, if you find anything not correct (in code, docs), please open an issue in this repository and I'll try to fix.
